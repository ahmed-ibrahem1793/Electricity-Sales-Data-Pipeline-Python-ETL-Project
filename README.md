**Electricity Sales Data Pipeline | Python ETL Project**

Built an end-to-end ETL pipeline in Python to process electricity sales data, extracting from CSV/JSON sources, transforming with Pandas, and loading to Parquet/CSV for optimized storage.

Engineered data transformations to filter residential/transportation sector records, clean missing values (price), and derive time dimensions (year/month) from raw timestamps, improving analysis readiness.

Implemented schema-aware data validation by enforcing file formats (CSV/Parquet/JSON) and handling edge cases (NA drops, column selection).
Automated loading with dynamic file-type detection, reducing manual effort for future dataset updates.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas (ETL), JSON/CSV/Parquet data formats, Data Cleaning, Modular Python Functions.
